Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

The branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Software engineering involves a more structured and organized software development process that includes requirements engineering, design, coding, testing, and maintenance. In contrast, software development may be a less structured process that involves writing code, testing, and deploying the software.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Scrum, an Agile framework, emphasizes iterative development, team collaboration, and flexibility to change. Work is divided into sprints. Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before proceeding to the next, making it less adaptable to change.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

Consider Agile if your project has dynamic requirements, needs frequent client feedback, and values adaptability. 
Approach - Iterative and incremental
Flexibility - High; welcomes changes even in late development stages
Project Planning - Minimal upfront planning; plans evolve as the project progresses
Customer Involvement - Continuous and high throughout the project
Testing - Integrated throughout the development cycles
Delivery - Incremental delivery throughout the project
Risk Management - Risks are managed throughout the project
FeedBack Incorporation - Feedback can be incorporated into the ongoing project
Project Scope - Dynamic and adaptable based on ongoing feedback
Team Structure - Cross-functional, collaborative teams
Documentation - Documentation is lightweight and produced as needed
Suitability - Suited for projects with evolving requirements.

Choose Waterfall for projects with well-defined requirements, limited client involvement during development, and where a structured approach is necessary.
Approach - Sequential and linear
Flexibility - Low; changes are difficult and costly once the project is underway
Project Planning - Extensive planning at the beginning of the project; changes are discouraged
Customer Involvement - Limited after the requirements phase
Testing - Conducted after the completion of the development phase
Delivery - Single delivery at the end of the project
Risk Management - Risks are identified and addressed during the initial stages
FeedBack Incorporation - Feedback is generally incorporated in future versions
Project Scope - Defined clearly at the beginning, and changes are rare
Team Structure - Teams work in silos based on the phase of the project
Documentation - Emphasizes comprehensive documentation at the start
Suitability - Best for projects with clear, fixed requirements

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Requirements Engineering is the practice of defining software manuscripts with sustaining requirement specification and its activities. It involves tasks such as requirement analysis, elicitation, documentation, conciliation, and validation

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Modularity in software design is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes, or components. It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestible parts
modularity can significantly enhance both maintenance and scalability of software. By dividing software into distinct modules, developers can manage, update, and scale parts of the application independently, leading to more efficient maintenance and easier scalability.

Maintenance Efficiency: Isolating issues within specific modules simplifies debugging and updating processes.
Scalability: Modular designs allow for adding, updating, or scaling specific modules without impacting the entire system.
Adaptability: Modular systems can more readily adapt to changing requirements or technologies.
Collaborative Development: Modularity supports concurrent development, where multiple teams can work on different modules simultaneously.

Modularity: Design software with interchangeable parts for flexibility and scalability. (n.d.). https://www.secoda.co/glossary/modularity#:~:text=Modularity%20in%20software%20design%20is,them%20down%20into%20digestible%20parts.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

Levels of Software Testing
Unit Testing: This involves testing individual components or units of the software in isolation. It is typically performed by developers and focuses on the smallest testable parts of the code.
Integration Testing: This level of testing involves combining individual units and testing them as a group to ensure they work together as expected. It verifies the interactions between integrated units.
System Testing: This level of testing evaluates the complete and integrated software product. It tests the system as a whole against the specified requirements.
Acceptance Testing: This is the final level of testing and is performed to determine whether the software is ready for release. It is often conducted by end-users or stakeholders to validate that the system meets their requirements.
Importance of Testing in Software Development
Testing is crucial in software development for several reasons:

Identifying Defects: Testing helps in identifying defects or bugs in the software, allowing them to be fixed before the product is released.
Ensuring Quality: It ensures that the software meets the specified requirements and functions as intended, leading to a higher quality product.
Risk Mitigation: Testing helps in mitigating the risks associated with software failures, which can have financial, legal, and reputational implications.
Customer Satisfaction: Thorough testing leads to a more reliable and stable product, which in turn leads to higher customer satisfaction.
Cost-Effectiveness: Identifying and fixing defects early in the development process is more cost-effective than addressing them after the product has been released.
In summary, testing is crucial in software development as it helps in delivering a high-quality, reliable, and user-friendly product while minimizing risks and costs associated with software failures.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Version control is defined as a system that tracks the progress of code across the software development lifecycle and its multiple iterations – which maintains a record of every change complete with authorship, timestamp, and other details – and also aids in managing change.

IBM Configuration Management Version Control (CMVC)
Software that carries out software version control, configuration management, and change management tasks is known as Configuration Management Version Control (CMVC). This system was client-server based, with servers for several Unix flavors and command-line and graphical clients for many platforms. Even after renaming a file, it can track file history. This is because developers may alter the database filename and the filename on the disk was a number. Delegating power is possible thanks to its decentralized administration.

Git
Git is among the most powerful version control programs now on the market. The creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds, created the distributed version control system known as Git. Its memory footprint is minimal and can follow changes in any file. When you add this to its extensive feature set, you get a full-featured version control system that can handle any project. Due to its simple workflow, it is employed by Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.

 Apache Subversion
A version control system called Apache Subversion, which is free and open-source, enables programmers to manage both the most recent and previous iterations of crucial files. It can track modifications to source code, web pages, and documentation for large-scale projects. Subversion’s main features are workflow management, user access limits, and cheap local branching. Both commercial products and individual projects can be managed using Subversion, a centralized system with many powerful features. It is one of Apache’s many open-source solutions, like Apache Cassandra.

GitHub
Software development teams may collaborate and keep track of all code changes using GitHub. You can keep track of code modifications, go back in time to correct mistakes, and collaborate with other team members. The most reliable, secure, and scalable developer platform in the world is GitHub. You receive the best resources and services to assist you in creating the most cutting-edge communities possible. The most reliable, secure, and scalable developer platform in the world is GitHub.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

A project software manager someone who “makes project goals their own and uses their skills and expertise to inspire a sense of shared purpose within the project team.”

Project managers are leaders — they not only ensure projects are delivered on time and within budget but must also engage and encourage their teams and inspire their clients. They need strong critical thinking capabilities to solve problems as they arise and finely-tuned communication skills (like a knack for customer service) to ensure everyone remains informed, motivated, and on board. It’s no wonder that project managers are considered critical to the success of any venture.

A project manager is responsible for overseeing a project from start to finish. The responsibilities of a project manager include: 

Planning the project
Creating a schedule and timeline
Executing each phase
Managing the budget
Serving as the liaison among all stakeholders
Troubleshooting and maintenance 
Project managers must be highly organized, detail-oriented, and possess excellent people skills — after all, they are responsible for leading the team and communicating clearly and regularly with all relevant parties.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. Software maintenance is done after the product has launched for several reasons including improving the software overall, correcting issues or bugs, to boost performance, and more.

Types of maintenance activities 
Corrective Software Maintenance
Corrective software maintenance is the typical, classic form of maintenance (for software and anything else for that matter). Corrective software maintenance is necessary when something goes wrong in a piece of software including faults and errors. These can have a widespread impact on the functionality of the software in general and therefore must be addressed as quickly as possible. 
Many times, software vendors can address issues that require corrective maintenance due to bug reports that users send in. If a company can recognize and take care of faults before users discover them, this is an added advantage that will make your company seem more reputable and reliable (no one likes an error message after all).

Preventative Software Maintenance
Preventative software maintenance is looking into the future so that your software can keep working as desired for as long as possible. 
This includes making necessary changes, upgrades, adaptations and more. Preventative software maintenance may address small issues which at the given time may lack significance but may turn into larger problems in the future. These are called latent faults which need to be detected and corrected to make sure that they won’t turn into effective faults. 

Perfective Software Maintenance
As with any product on the market, once the software is released to the public, new issues and ideas come to the surface. Users may see the need for new features or requirements that they would like to see in the software to make it the best tool available for their needs. This is when perfective software maintenance comes into play. 
Perfective software maintenance aims to adjust software by adding new features as necessary and removing features that are irrelevant or not effective in the given software. This process keeps software relevant as the market, and user needs, change. 

Adaptive Software Maintenance
Adaptive software maintenance has to do with the changing technologies as well as policies and rules regarding your software. These include operating system changes, cloud storage, hardware, etc. When these changes are performed, your software must adapt in order to properly meet new requirements and continue to run well. 

Importance of Software Maintenance
Creating a new piece of software and launching it into the world is an exciting step for any company. A lot goes into creating your software and its launch including the actual building and coding, licensing models, marketing, and more. However, any great piece of software must be able to adapt to the times. 
This means monitoring and maintaining properly. As technology is changing at the speed of light, software must keep up with the market changes and demands.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

ethical issues and how developers can address them:

addictive design;
corporate ownership of personal data;
algorithmic bias;
weak cyber security and personally identifiable information (PII) protection; and
overemphasis on features.

Reflect ethics priorities throughout software lifecycle from design to operation. Train staff on ethical choices such as open source software licensing and use. Teach developers, architects, testers and other software team members about data management practices that comply with regulations and customer expectations. Developers don't follow news on the latest legislative actions in the jurisdictions where customers use their software, Mackey pointed out, but the business must ensure they're informed.

 Addictive design
Every developer yearns to create applications that people love to use -- that's just good UX design. The problem is that some teams craft apps that people love too much. There is an ethical concern about the role of digital platforms, such as social media.

"As long as social media companies profit from outrage, confusion, addiction and depression, our well-being and democracy are at risk," argue critics like Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology. Harris notably went viral while at working Google, with a presentation about the push for addictive technology design and companies' moral responsibility in society.

Striking an ethical balance between products consumers love and products that hijack their attention is more an art than a science. In product creation and updates, ask the following questions:

Who benefits?
How do they benefit?
To what degree do they benefit?
Are there safeguards for user health and sanity?
How overt is monetization and customer data collection and use, including via AI and machine learning (ML)? How transparent are these practices?
Explore addictive design, suggests David K. Bain, vice president of standards for the Telecommunications Industry Association, by comparing popular apps like Duolingo and TikTok. Both apps generate growth and revenue for their creators, but the nature of their benefit to users is different. Duolingo's clients gain language skills and are challenged with activities that enhance neuronal growth and brain plasticity. TikTok users receive cultural knowledge as well as immediate gratification with video content that bathes the brain with intoxicating neurotransmitters. "Based on this, many adults would say that the true user benefit of Duolingo is greater than [that of] TikTok," Bain said, but added that his 15-year-old daughter would disagree.

The two apps have different attitudes toward usage limits meant to safeguard against addictive attachment. Duolingo encourages consistency and makes the strong case that its use is linked to optimized learning curves. Duolingo definitely grabs users by the lapels to meet their daily quota and maintain performance streaks. But once the daily activities are done, Duolingo releases the user. By contrast, TikTok entices users to stay with an essentially limitless buffet of consumable media.

Apps often include user manipulation, monetization methods, user data collection for corporate use and machine learning algorithms to enhance the app. Transparency means what the users actually know and understand about these practices. Here's how this ethical aspect plays out in the two example apps:

"Duolingo's users are clearly willing victims of an enforced daily regimen, but are most certainly not aware that ads and usage data connect to a much larger advertising ecosystem," Bain said. "TikTok's users, especially the younger ones, I am quite sure are largely and happily oblivious to the methods and outcomes of their addictions."

Questionable personal data ownership
AI-based processing of biometric and other contextual data about customers has increased exponentially with device and software evolution. Software can profile users and predict behaviors at a scary level of detail.

"Usually, the ethical question is [one of] what to do with that data," said Miguel Lopes, vice president of product line management at Vidyo, a video conference platform. This ethical issue is a dilemma for developers in every kind of business -- not just the social media giants who make the news.

An algorithm directs information collection and building a profile, but the subsequent actions are intentional, and the developer is ordinarily aware of the power of this data in context.

One of the root causes of ethical concerns relates to how the business generates revenue and incentivizes developers and business managers, Lopes argued. In many cases, companies look at user data as a valuable currency, and want to monetize the data they store. "These factors might cause these organizations to share their user data unethically," Lopes said.

Developers face a hard decision regarding personal data and software design. They can create systems to exploit user data with the understanding that the liability lies with the organization, or they can raise concerns but face potential penalization for going against the project's aims. Modern technology companies' working culture should let developers come forward with personal data ownership concerns without fear of retaliation.

These kinds of concerns galvanized some rich discussion at Vidyo, which decided not to offer a free service tier. "We have analyzed the implications and prefer to sustain our operations by selling our service instead of our user data, and not subjecting our developer team with these difficult choices," Lopez said. The company has also found that transparency, internally, is a crucial factor. Developers should be aware of the entire context of the project they are working on, not just the module they need to complete.

Companies should make it easy for developers to step forward with concerns. The HR department could create mechanisms where developers can express their concerns without the fear of retaliation, such as an anonymous hotline for ethical concerns. The organization should then follow up and independently identify if the use case is in breach of privacy, legal or ethical policies.

Algorithmic bias
Technology can amplify existing biases. "One of the more pressing ethical issues facing today's developers is bias," said Spencer Lentz, principal, AI and digital process automation, digital customer experience, at consulting firm Capgemini.

Bias often enters the system undetected -- Lentz compares bias to a virus. Computers themselves have no inherent moral framework. Software can only learn from the training it is given. Therefore, developers and data scientists must scrub bias from the training data and the algorithms they build. From a developer's perspective, bias often centers on eliminating options for the wrong reasons, Lentz said.

Reporting and research in recent years illustrates how bias within software systems can perpetuate systemic racism against specific populations, which creates lost opportunity, worsens medical care and increases rates of incarceration. For example, in the book, Race After Technology, Ruha Benjamin raised some concerns about a case where developers failed to include Black people's voices in training AI speech recognition algorithms, under the belief that fewer Black people would use the app.

Anaconda, a data science platform, conducts the "State of Data Science Survey" and in 2020 found that 27% of data practitioners thought the biggest problem to tackle in AI and ML was the social impact from bias in data and models.

"To reduce bias in data and models, practitioners must be intentional about their work, asking questions like 'How was this data collected,' and 'What assumptions were collected with it,' said Peter Wang, CEO and co-founder of Anaconda. "If you don't know how the data that trained your models was collected and under what conditions, then your models could inadvertently perpetuate biases in their outputs." Executives, data scientists and developers must create an organizational culture that establishes ethical guidelines and empowers individuals at any level of the business to speak up if they see something problematic.

It's time to create a governing body, similar to the American Medical Association for doctors, Wang argued. This body could establish industry-wide ethical guidelines and best practices. "These technologies are still relatively new in the business context, and we would all benefit from ethical standards derived from our collective intelligence and input, rather than leaving it up to each individual or organization to decide for themselves," he said.

Weak security and PII protection
Application security is growing in importance as software plays a larger role in our online and offline environments.

Developers often only address security after code release, rather than during development. As a result, the software community lacks secure development standards. "The emphasis is almost entirely on getting a product out to market," said Randolph Morris, CEO of Bit Developers, a software development consultancy. Once a software product is publicly available, the focus shifts to new features and performance optimization, so security continues to have minimal prominence.

Hackers and other malicious actors cause real damage to real people. Our current digital ecosystem tends to address application security by plugging vulnerabilities as they are found. The reactionary approach is neither practical nor pragmatic.

To address this ethical responsibility for customer safety, developers need education, but typically only cybersecurity-specific classes address these topics. To start, educate your team about cybersecurity failures such as the Anthem medical data breach in 2015, where PII was stored as plain text in a database. "If this information was encrypted, it would not have been so easy to use and valuable to distribute," Morris said.

Also, the industry needs revised security standards. Organizations can do more to embrace standards meant to protect PII. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and HIPAA for health apps are a good start, but developers should consider other forms of PII as well, and software designs that protect it.

Prioritizing features over impact
At the center of many ethical issues is a decision that capabilities in software releases are more important than the effects they could have. But just because you can doesn't mean you should.

"If the development team is measured on their rate of feature development, there's a high probability that the ethics of a given implementation might not be front of mind, either at the design or at the implementation phase," said Tim Mackey, principal security strategist at Synopsys Cyber Security Research Center. Synopsys is an electronic design automation company.

The business itself must set the tone for ethical standards in its software. Reflect ethics priorities throughout software lifecycle from design to operation. Train staff on ethical choices such as open source software licensing and use. Teach developers, architects, testers and other software team members about data management practices that comply with regulations and customer expectations. Developers don't follow news on the latest legislative actions in the jurisdictions where customers use their software, Mackey pointed out, but the business must ensure they're informed.

Collaboration between engineering leadership and legal teams can avoid ethical shortcomings. For example, the business should focus on customers' personal data access and retention. Data access controls and logging mechanisms are enabled at software implementation time. Developers -- tasked with creating a functional, user-friendly product -- will view data access restrictions as the responsibility of another team. Instead, ensure data protection is a feature included in the software design, inherently protecting against unauthorized access.
